### **5. CALCULATION LOGIC & DATA MODEL**

#### **5.1 Key Data Points to Track**

| Data Point | Description & Purpose |
|------------|----------------------|
| **User Rank** | The user's rank (1-4) for each word in all 18 sets. This is the primary input. |
| **Basadur Score** | The converted score (1-4) for each word, used for the actual calculation. |
| **Column Totals** | The four raw score totals, one for each column, summed from the 12 included rows. |
| **Final Percentages** | The four final percentage scores, one for each quadrant. Used for report display and radar chart. |
| **Dominant Quadrant** | The quadrant with the highest percentage score. Highlighted in the final report. |

#### **5.2 Step 1: User Rank to Basadur Score Conversion**

The user's drag-and-drop action creates a ranking from 1 (top, "most like me") to 4 (bottom, "least like me"). The original Basadur inventory uses a 4-point system where 4 is "most characteristic." To align our UI with the official scoring, we must convert the user's rank.

✅ **User Rank System**
> ● `1`: Top position (Most like me)
> ● `2`: Second position
> ● `3`: Third position
> ● `4`: Bottom position (Least like me)

✅ **Conversion Formula**
```
Basadur Score = 5 - User Rank
```

✅ **Conversion Examples**
> ● User Rank 1 (top) → Basadur Score = 5 - 1 = 4
> ● User Rank 4 (bottom) → Basadur Score = 5 - 4 = 1

#### **5.3 Step 2: Column Score Calculation**

The calculation uses the `Basadur Score` for each word, summed column-wise, but only for specific rows.

✅ **Row Exclusion (Official Basadur Methodology)**
> **Excluded Rows:** 1, 2, 5, 10, 14, 17 (6 rows total)

✅ **Row Inclusion**
> **Included Rows:** 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18 (12 rows total)

✅ **Summation Process**
> 1. For each of the 12 included rows, get the `Basadur Score` for the word in each of the four columns
> 2. Sum these scores for each column individually
> 3. Result: Four raw `Column Totals`

#### **5.4 Step 3: Mapping Columns to Quadrants**

Based on the original Basadur methodology and final report UI requirements:

| Column Number | Original Dimension | Final Quadrant Profile |
|---------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Column 1** | Experiencing | **Implementer** |
| **Column 2** | Ideation | **Generator** |
| **Column 3** | Thinking | **Conceptualizer** |
| **Column 4** | Evaluation | **Optimizer** |

#### **5.5 Step 4: Final Percentage Calculation**

✅ **Maximum Score Calculation**
> Maximum possible score for any column = 12 (included rows) × 4 (max Basadur Score) = **48**

✅ **Percentage Formula**
```
Quadrant % = (Column Total / 48) × 100
```
> Result rounded to whole number

#### **5.6 Step 5: Final Report Data Generation**

✅ **Dominant Quadrant Identification**
> ● Identify quadrant with highest percentage
> ● Display prominently in report

✅ **Secondary Quadrants Ordering**
> ● List remaining three quadrants in descending order by percentage

✅ **Radar Chart Data Mapping**
> ● **Ideation Axis:** Plots the **Generator** percentage
> ● **Experiencing Axis:** Plots the **Implementer** percentage  
> ● **Evaluation Axis:** Plots the **Optimizer** percentage
> ● **Thinking Axis:** Plots the **Conceptualizer** percentage

---

### **6. ERROR HANDLING & DATA PERSISTENCE**

#### **6.1 Data Persistence Strategy**
✅ **LocalStorage Implementation**
> ● Application state (all rankings + current question number) saved to browser's LocalStorage on every change
> ● Data timestamped to manage session validity
> ● **Session Grace Period:** 10-minute Time To Live (TTL)
> ● If user returns within 10 minutes: Progress restored to exact last position
> ● If more than 10 minutes passed: Session expired, user starts from beginning

#### **6.2 Progress Loss Scenarios**

✅ **Accidental Browser/Tab Closure or Refresh**
> ● **Behavior:** Progress safe within 10-minute grace period
> ● **Recovery:** System checks timestamp of saved data on reload
> ● **Within window:** User restored to exact last position
> ● **Expired:** User starts fresh

✅ **Browser "Back" Button Navigation**
> ● **Behavior:** Application uses router to manage history
> ● **Function:** Clicking browser "Back" navigates to previous screen seamlessly
> ● **Data:** No warning prompt needed - all progress continuously saved

#### **6.3 Mobile-Specific Scenarios**

✅ **Interruption (Phone Call, Notification)**
> ● **Grace Period:** 10-minute session TTL applies
> ● **Within 10 minutes:** Session intact upon return
> ● **Beyond 10 minutes:** Must start over

✅ **Device Rotation**
> ● **Behavior:** Non-interrupting event
> ● **Response:** Interface re-renders to fit new orientation
> ● **Data:** All progress and state maintained seamlessly via LocalStorage
