Ok I am planning to create a web application for my iot class. 
so bascially my teacher uses this method called basadur profile to understand how a person approach challenges & innovation. 
ALl they have to do is a simple thing where they have to rank 18 sets of 4 words each. 
SO the way they have to rank is like the top word is the one that resembles them the most. 
leter they will be given 4  titles , generator, conceptualiser, optimizer, implementor

I am planning to build this using a react , and jsx files. 

I will be giving the whole complete details here on how I am gonna build this whole thing. 

let us begin with fonts 
I am using Martian mono and IBM Plex sans (Regular, medium, semibold, bold) to design this application here. 

coming to the colours, we will be using these colours mainly

Checkpoint Screens (Q0, Q6, Q12)

2.5.1 Overview & Purpose
To enhance user engagement and reduce cognitive fatigue during the 18-question ranking process, checkpoint screens are displayed at key milestones. These screens serve as brief, motivational pauses that break the test into manageable sections, reassure the user of their progress, and create a more dynamic and supportive experience.
They appear at the following intervals:
Before Question 1 (Initiation)
Before Question 7 (Mid-point encouragement)
Before Question 13 (Final stretch motivation)
2.5.2 Common UI & Design Elements
All checkpoint screens share a consistent layout and set of components:
Full-Screen Background: Each milestone is distinguished by a unique, vibrant, and solid background color from the brand's bright accent palette.
Progress Bar: A horizontal progress bar is positioned at the top of the screen.
Left Label: Displays the current progress numerically (e.g., "0 OF 18").
Right Label: Displays the progress as a percentage (e.g., "0%").
Fill: The bar visually fills from left to right. The unfilled portion of the bar is a lighter tint of the background color, while the filled portion uses the paired dark color for high contrast.
Motivational Heading: Centered on the screen, the heading uses large, friendly typography to deliver a brief, encouraging message. Part of the message is emphasized (e.g., bold or italic) to add a human, conversational tone.
Call-to-Action (CTA) Button: A large, pill-shaped button is centered below the heading.
Color Palette: The design strictly follows the "Paired Accents" system. The text and CTA button background color are the designated dark pair for the screen's bright background color, ensuring high contrast, readability, and brand consistency.
2.5.3 Checkpoint-Specific Content

Ranking Screen

2.6.1 Overview & Purpose
The Ranking Screen is the core interactive component of the application. On this screen, users are presented with a set of four words, which they must rank according to how well each word describes them. The design prioritizes clarity, intuitive interaction, and seamless feedback.
2.6.2 UI & Design Elements
Progress Bar:
Description: The standard progress bar component is displayed at the top. Its color corresponds to the current checkpoint's theme (e.g., blue for the first 6 questions).
Left Label: Displays the current question number, formatted as "SET [x] OF 18".
Right Label: Displays the percentage of questions completed within the current set/checkpoint as a whole number.
Instructional Text:
Description: A brief, single-line text below the progress bar provides clear instructions.
Example Copy: "Drag to rank‚Äîtop is most like you. Tap ‚ìò for definitions."
Ranking Boundary Indicators:
Description: To provide a clear spatial context for the ranking task, two static, uppercase text labels frame the draggable area.
Top Label: "MOST LIKE ME"
Bottom Label: "LEAST LIKE ME"
2.6.3 Draggable Word Component
This component represents each of the four words to be ranked. It has two primary states.
Normal (Collapsed) State:
Layout: A horizontally aligned container.
Left: A six-dot drag handle icon (‚†ø) indicating draggability.
Center: The alphabetized word (e.g., "a. Ready"). The text is left-aligned next to the handle.
Right: A circled info icon (‚ìò).
Styling: Contained within a rounded rectangle with a light border or subtle shadow to define its boundary.
Expanded State (On Info Click):
Trigger: The user clicks the info icon (‚ìò).
Appearance:
The component expands vertically to reveal the word's definition directly below the word itself.
The icon on the right dynamically changes from an info icon (‚ìò) to an upward-facing chevron or arrow (Ô∏ø), indicating that clicking it again will collapse the view.
Behavior: Only one Word Component can be in the expanded state at any given time. If a user expands a second component, the previously opened one automatically collapses.
Interaction Logic:
Persistent Alphabetization: The alphabet prefix (a., b., c., d.) is permanently associated with its corresponding word. It does not re-alphabetize when the order is changed. This provides users with a consistent reference point, confirming that they have successfully moved a specific item.
Drag-and-Drop: Users can drag a component even when it is in its expanded state. The component smoothly animates to its new position in the list upon being dropped.
2.6.4 Save Confirmation Indicator
Description: An inline text indicator located below the ranking area (above the navigation buttons) provides real-time feedback on the save status of the user's rankings.
State Flow:
Idle State: No text or icon is visible.
Saving State: Immediately upon a drag-and-drop action, this state is triggered for a brief duration (~300ms). It displays the text "Saving..." next to a small loading spinner icon.
Saved State: Following the "Saving" state, it transitions to display the text "Changes saved" next to a green checkmark icon (‚úî). This state persists until another change is made.
2.6.5 Navigation
Layout: Two pill-shaped buttons are aligned at the bottom of the screen.
Back Button:
Style: Secondary styling (e.g., light gray background, dark text).
Functionality: Navigates the user to the previous screen (either the previous question or a checkpoint screen). The user's saved rankings for the current question are preserved.
Next Button:
Style: Primary styling (e.g., solid accent color background, light text).
Functionality: Navigates the user to the next screen (either the next question, a checkpoint screen, or the final report screen).


Report Generation Screen (Interstitial)

2.7.1 Overview & Purpose
After the user answers the final question, a brief interstitial screen is displayed. Its purpose is to create a seamless transition and build anticipation for the results. By simulating a "calculation" process, it makes the final report feel more significant and thoughtfully prepared.
2.7.2 UI & Design Elements
Behavior: This screen appears automatically for a fixed duration of 2-3 seconds before transitioning to the Final Report Screen. It requires no user interaction.
Background Color: #FFD7EF (Bright Pink), providing a vibrant and engaging visual pause.
Heading:
Text: "Just a second..."
Style: Large, prominent, and bolded typography to capture attention.
Subheading:
Text: "we're mapping out your creative style based on how you ranked."
Style: Smaller, lighter-weight font positioned directly below the heading.
2.8 Final Report Screen
2.8.1 Overview & Purpose
This screen presents the user with their personalized Basadur Profile results. The design is a dynamic, card-based interface that is themed according to the user's dominant quadrant, providing a visually rich and personalized summary of their creative problem-solving style.
2.8.2 Overall Structure & Dynamic Theming
The entire report is contained within a single, large card with rounded corners. The card's color scheme is determined by the user's dominant quadrant, using the established "Paired Accents" system.
Dominant Quadrant	Bright Accent (for Highlights)	Dark Pair (for Card Background)
Generator	#A0E1E1 (Bright Blue)	#21231D (Dark Charcoal)
Conceptualizer	#FFEB69 (Bright Yellow)	#3A341C (Dark Gold)
Optimizer	#FFC091 (Bright Orange)	#260A2F (Dark Purple)
Implementer	#FFD7EF (Bright Pink)	#320707 (Dark Maroon)
2.8.3 UI & Design Elements
Header:
Text: "Your Basadur Profile"
Style: Centered at the top of the screen (above the card), using minimalist, light-colored text to provide context without distracting from the results.
Radar Chart (Spider Web Graph):
Description: The top portion of the card is dedicated to a radar chart visualizing the four quadrant scores.
Axes: The four axes are labeled: IDEATION, EXPERIENCING, EVALUATION, and THINKING.
Styling: The grid lines, axes labels, and the plotted shape's outline all use the dominant quadrant's Bright Accent color. The plotted shape has a semi-transparent fill of the same color.
Results Summary:
Layout: Positioned below the radar chart, this area displays the numerical results.
Dominant Quadrant Display:
The user's highest score is featured prominently.
The percentage (e.g., "60%") is displayed in a large, bold font.
The quadrant name (e.g., "GENERATOR") is displayed below the percentage in a smaller, uppercase font.
Both the percentage and name are colored with the dominant quadrant's Bright Accent color.
Secondary Quadrants Display:
The remaining three quadrants are listed vertically to the right of the dominant result.
Each line displays the percentage followed by the quadrant name (e.g., "18% OPTIMIZER").
The list is ordered by percentage in descending order.
This text uses a neutral, light color (e.g., off-white) to ensure the dominant result remains the primary focal point.
Action Buttons (CTAs):
Layout: Two pill-shaped buttons are stacked vertically at the bottom of the card.
Primary CTA: Download Report
Style: Solid fill using the dominant quadrant's Bright Accent color. The text and icon use the corresponding Dark Pair color for high contrast.
Content: An icon of a document/download (üìÑ) followed by the text "Download report".
Secondary CTA: Take Test Again
Style: A lighter, secondary style (e.g., a semi-transparent light gray or a tint of the dark pair background).
Content: An icon of a refresh/redo arrow (üîÑ) followed by the text "Take test again".
